Disable enqueuing of Open Sans and other fonts used by WordPress from Google.

== Description ==

[Plugin homepage](https://milandinic.com/wordpress/plugins/disable-google-fonts/) | [Plugin author](https://milandinic.com/) | [Donate](https://milandinic.com/donate/)

This plugin stops loading of Open Sans and other fonts used by WordPress core or bundled themes (Twenty Twelve, Twenty Thirteen, Twenty Fourteen, Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Sixteen, Twenty Seventeen) from Google Fonts. If another theme or plugin uses fonts from Google Fonts, those fonts still might be loaded.

Reasons for not using Google Fonts might be privacy and security, local development or production, blocking of Google's servers, characters not supported by font, performance.

Disable Google Fonts is a very lightweight, it has no settings, just activate it and it works immediately.

And it's on [GitHub](https://github.com/dimadin/disable-google-fonts).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `disable-google-fonts` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
